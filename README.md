This is the Udacity Data Wrangler project for WeRateDogs twitter account.  The tweepy cell requires Twitter account credentials that you will need to provide if you want to run that cell.  Otherwise, you can just skip that cell and everything else will run with the data files provided.  This project has numerous pandas data manipulation examples and follows the formatting and documentation guidelines that Udacity requires.
